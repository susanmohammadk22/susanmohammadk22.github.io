The methodology employed for this review utilizes a PRISMA-based search strategy focused on the query \"Machine Learning and Data Mining Applications in US Enterprise 2012-2024,\" targeting high-impact journals in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The industrial scope encompasses Finance, Healthcare, Retail, and Technology sectors, with data evaluation metrics primarily focused on predictive accuracy (F1-score, AUC-ROC), operational efficiency (ROI), and computational cost (latency/throughput).\n\nThe research of Eloundou, Manning, and Mishkin (2024) in their article The Dual Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Corporate Employment and Valuation establishes the current paradigm of \"Generative Augmentation\" in US tech and service sectors. The authors hypothesize that Generative AI (GenAI) acts as a high-skill labor intensifier rather than a simple replacement tool, particularly for data-intensive roles like accounting and software engineering. Their tests, which aggregate task-based exposure across thousands of firm-level positions, reveal that post-ChatGPT (2022–2024), US firms with higher AI exposure saw increased average wages and initial valuation spikes. The finding indicates that while GenAI provides an average labor cost saving of 25%, the primary hurdle is a \"realization gap\" where firms struggle to translate potential productivity into tangible quarterly performance, identifying a critical trend toward organizational restructuring as a prerequisite for ML value.\n\nIn the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, Siva Sai et al. (2024) in The Transformative Impact of Generative AI across Industries: A Comprehensive Systematic Review examine the shift from diagnostic to generative applications. The researchers hypothesized that integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) would significantly accelerate drug discovery and medical imaging analysis in the US. By testing real-world scenarios in medical education and clinical diagnostics, the study found that GAN-based data mining could generate high-fidelity synthetic patient data, overcoming the privacy barriers of the HIPAA era. The outcome demonstrates that while diagnostic accuracy improved, the methodology’s weakness lies in \"hallucination\" risks and ethical biases, highlighting a research gap in regulatory frameworks for autonomous medical AI within US corporations.\n\nShifting to the 2020–2022 \"Big Data Velocity\" era, Uddin et al. (2023) in their review Recent Trends in Machine Learning for Healthcare Big Data Applications focus on the scalability of tree-based models and AutoML. Their central hypothesis suggested that feature set selection (FSS) is more critical for corporate efficiency than the choice of the neural network itself. By testing the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) on large-scale RNA-Seq datasets, they found that TPOT-FSS completed tasks 17 times faster than standard models without sacrificing accuracy. This results in a summary of findings that emphasizes the \"Green AI\" trend, where US corporations are moving away from massive compute-heavy models toward computationally efficient, power-aware ML pipelines to meet sustainability goals.\n\nWithin the financial sector, Alshater et al. (2022) in Artificial Intelligence in Financial Market Prediction analyze the mid-period (2016–2019) transition toward deep reinforcement learning for stock market forecasting. The article hypothesizes that combining traditional data mining of historical prices with real-time sentiment analysis from social media would yield a statistically significant alpha in high-frequency trading. The tests, utilizing Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines, confirmed that multimodal data sources enhanced prediction accuracy by providing a \"holistic perspective\" on market sentiment. However, the study identifies a methodological weakness in \"model drift,\" where ML models trained on pre-pandemic data failed to generalize during the 2020 volatility, revealing a gap in the literature regarding \"Robustness under Crisis\" for corporate financial algorithms.\n\nThe foundational period of 2012–2015 is characterized by Chaudhary et al. (2016) in their synthesis of \"Big Data Mining\" in US retail. The hypothesis of this era was that moving from descriptive Business Intelligence (BI) to predictive data mining could reduce inventory overhead by 15% through more accurate demand forecasting. Tests performed on US retail giants using Hadoop and Spark frameworks showed that early ML models (SVM and Logistic Regression) were highly effective at detecting fraud and predicting churn, but were limited by the \"siloed\" nature of corporate data. This results in a summary of findings that points to the trend of \"Data Democratization,\" where the methodology's strength was its ability to handle volume, but its weakness was a lack of real-time adaptability, a gap that was eventually filled by the streaming analytics of the late 2010s.\n\nThe synthesized trend analysis across the 2012–2024 spectrum reveals a clear trajectory from retrospective data mining to autonomous antigenic ML. The primary research gap identified is the \"governance-efficiency paradox,\" where the technical capacity for corporate automation outpaces the legal and ethical frameworks required to manage it. While current US corporate practices are moving toward \"Small Language Models\" (SLMs) and decentralized \"Federated Learning\" to protect data privacy, the literature shows a persistent weakness in the lack of longitudinal studies on AI's impact on corporate culture and long-term skill degradation. The review concludes that the next frontier of US corporate ML will focus on \"Explainability and Trust,\" moving the hypothesis from purely performance-based metrics to \"Accountable Intelligence.\"\nthis is the result of what I received from Gemini. not my work it is write by AI- Gemini\n\nStep 5: Reflection\nTask: Write a reflection answering:\n1) How did each model approach the systematic review differently? in copilot it produce a segmented and academically format for the review but it was not reliable as it did not mentioned about the resources. in Gemini it shows methodology and spoke about the study, its metrics and outcome. deppseek created more content than other AI models and offered more details of each study also mentioned the resources. so I would rely on deep seek as it provide more detail information about studies.\n\n2) Which prompt refinements yielded the best results for each model? for copilot the structure was the best result that I wanted of a formal literature review result with academic word and format but without resources. Gemini needed methodology details and metrics. Deep seek was good in terms of the details and resources. \n\n3) I learned that AI models need a precies prompt and structured one of what we want from them to generate the appropriate result for us. so it is a best collaborative option but in the end we need to check the results and update it in a way that we want. \n\n3) What did you learn about leveraging AI for structured academic\nreviews?\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n2/6/2026 Question 4: What problems do you encounter when working with the dataset?

The tests, utilizing Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines, confirmed that multimodal data sources enhanced prediction accuracy by providing a \"holistic perspective\" on market sentiment. However, the study identifies a methodological weakness in \"model drift,\" where ML models trained on pre-pandemic data failed to generalize during the 2020 volatility, revealing a gap in the literature regarding \"Robustness under Crisis\" for corporate financial algorithms.\n\nThe foundational period of 2012–2015 is characterized by Chaudhary et al. (2016) in their synthesis of \"Big Data Mining\" in US retail. The hypothesis of this era was that moving from descriptive Business Intelligence (BI) to predictive data mining could reduce inventory overhead by 15% through more accurate demand forecasting. Tests performed on US retail giants using Hadoop and Spark frameworks showed that early ML models (SVM and Logistic Regression) were highly effective at detecting fraud and predicting churn, but were limited by the \"siloed\" nature of corporate data. This results in a summary of findings that points to the trend of \"Data Democratization,\" where the methodology's strength was its ability to handle volume, but its weakness was a lack of real-time adaptability, a gap that was eventually filled by the streaming analytics of the late 2010s.\n\nThe synthesized trend analysis across the 2012–2024 spectrum reveals a clear trajectory from retrospective data mining to autonomous antigenic ML. The primary research gap identified is the \"governance-efficiency paradox,\" where the technical capacity for corporate automation outpaces the legal and ethical frameworks required to manage it. While current US corporate practices are moving toward \"Small Language Models\" (SLMs) and decentralized \"Federated Learning\" to protect data privacy, the literature shows a persistent weakness in the lack of longitudinal studies on AI's impact on corporate culture and long-term skill degradation. The review concludes that the next frontier of US corporate ML will focus on \"Explainability and Trust,\" moving the hypothesis from purely performance-based metrics to \"Accountable Intelligence.\"\nthis is the result of what I received from Gemini. not my work it is write by AI- Gemini\n\nStep 5: Reflection\nTask: Write a reflection answering:\n1) How did each model approach the systematic review differently? in copilot it produce a segmented and academically format for the review but it was not reliable as it did not mentioned about the resources. in Gemini it shows methodology and spoke about the study, its metrics and outcome. deppseek created more content than other AI models and offered more details of each study also mentioned the resources. so I would rely on deep seek as it provide more detail information about studies.\n\n2) Which prompt refinements yielded the best results for each model? for copilot the structure was the best result that I wanted of a formal literature review result with academic word and format but without resources. Gemini needed methodology details and metrics. Deep seek was good in terms of the details and resources. \n\n3) I learned that AI models need a precies prompt and structured one of what we want from them to generate the appropriate result for us. so it is a best collaborative option but in the end we need to check the results and update it in a way that we want. \n\n3) What did you learn about leveraging AI for structured academic\nreviews?\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"assignment2.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
