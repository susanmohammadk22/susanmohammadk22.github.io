Question 4: What problems do you encounter when working with the dataset?
Answer:
1) when I paste the code inside of the assignment document I received this error.
Error in `haven::read_dta()`:
! This kind of input is not handled.
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.

Backtrace:
    ▆
 1. └─haven::read_dta("https://github.com/datageneration/home/blob/master/DataProgra\nmming/data/TEDS_2016.dta?raw=true")
Run rlang::last_trace(drop = FALSE) to see 2 hidden frames.

while Chat GPT said I should write read_stat instead of read_data.
2) I paste this from the book:
> # Prepare the analyze the Party ID variable 
> # Assign label to the values (1=KMT, 2=DPP, 3=NP, 4=PFP, 5=TSU, 6=NPP, 7="NA")
> 
> TEDS_2016$PartyID <- factor(TEDS_2016$PartyID, labels=c("KMT","DPP","NP","PFP", "TSU", "NPP","NA"))
> # Check the variable
> attach(TEDS_2016)
> head(PartyID)
[1] NA  NA  KMT NA  NA  DPP
Levels: KMT DPP NP PFP TSU NPP NA
> 

then I received very NA in the first column.
Question 5:
Answer: then when I installed the ## install.packages("descr"), and run the library I cuold see all data without NA.

I had a challenge when I wanted to make this code 
> ggplot(TEDS_2016, aes(x = Tondu)) +
+   geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) +
+   scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +

+   ylab("Percentage of Respondents (%)")

I did not know that what would be the x lable and y lable for this report

2 questions after class

originality and AI : it means to me that the way we ask questions and ask it prepare or create something that is the original part while the AI by itself cannot create something from the zero as it use algorithm and reading current data and information.

What is AGI? Artifitial General Inteligence
this type of AI is smarter and be close to human more compare to others as it can learn new skills. if this becomes reallity will be helpful in terms of finding new remedies for some cancer or finding new medication. but it will be a substitute for human
